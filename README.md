## General Information
A bike sharing company BoomBikes wants to understand the factors on which the demand for shared bikes depends. 

The company wants to know:
1. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
2. How well those variables describe the bike demands.

The firm wants to create a Linear Regression model to understand the demand of shared bikes with the available independent variables in the dataset. The model will subsequently be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features, giving important business insights. Using the valuable information the company will refine their business strategy to meet the demand levels and customer expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market

## Conclusions
1. Increase in temp will drive higher demand for bike sharing.
2. During Winter season there is expected increase in numbers for bike sharing.
3. Demand is high during working day and saturdays.
4. Demand will be less on days with high wind speed.
